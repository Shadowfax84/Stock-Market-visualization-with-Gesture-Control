Now that we r done with dashboard 
Let's make a general analysis chart for all the stocks
what I wanted to do is show the 13 sectors and 
as I select a sector I want to see all the stocks in that sector
the stock should change dynamically as I choose a different sector 
then I want to plot chart that change dynamically as I choose a different stock
the charts I want to plot are 
1.Price Chart with Moving Averages
Chart 1: Interactive 3D Price Chart
Render the stock's closing price over time as a 3D line chart, allowing users to rotate and zoom the visualization
Incorporate the 50-day and 200-day SMAs as additional 3D line plots
Add interactive elements like tooltips to display detailed price information on hover
Chart 2: Animated Price Heatmap
Create a heatmap visualization of the stock's daily price movements
Use a color gradient to represent the price levels, with hot colors for high prices and cool colors for low prices
Animate the heatmap over time to show the dynamic price changes
2. Volatility and Momentum Indicators
Chart 3: Interactive Bollinger Band Tunnel
Render the stock's closing price as a line plot
Create a 3D "tunnel" around the price line using the upper and lower Bollinger Bands
Allow users to adjust the Bollinger Band parameters and see the tunnel change in real-time
Chart 4: Radial RSI Visualization
Display the RSI indicator on a radial chart, with the RSI value represented by the distance from the center
Use color coding to highlight overbought and oversold regions
Add interactive elements like tooltips to provide detailed RSI information
3. Volume and Momentum Indicators
Chart 5: 3D OBV Waterfall
Represent the OBV indicator as a 3D waterfall chart, with the height of the "waterfall" corresponding to the OBV value
Animate the waterfall to show the changes in OBV over time
Incorporate interactive features like zooming and panning to allow users to explore the data
Chart 6: Force Index Sparkline Matrix
Create a grid of small sparkline charts, each representing the Force Index over a specific time period
Use color coding and size variations to highlight the relative strength and direction of the Force Index
Allow users to hover over individual sparklines to see detailed Force Index information
4. Candlestick Chart
Chart 7: Interactive Candlestick Carousel
Display the candlestick chart in a carousel-style format, allowing users to swipe or click through the historical data
Incorporate interactive features like zooming, panning, and tooltips to provide detailed information about each candlestick
Use dynamic lighting and shadows to create a visually striking and immersive candlestick chart experience
